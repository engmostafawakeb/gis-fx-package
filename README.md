### 2. Custom Control Panel  
A **custom control panel** allows developers to manage map-related user actions and dynamically adjust map behavior.

#### Control Panel Capabilities  
- Enable/disable control panal  
- Update Marker Icons  

### 3. Interactive Map Shapes  
The package allows adding and manipulating shapes dynamically during the applicationâ€™s runtime. Supported shapes include:  
- **Markers**: icons at specific locations  
- **Polygons**: Multi-point areas  
- **Circles**: Defined by center and radius  
- **Polylines**: Lines connecting multiple points  

### 4. Event Tracking  
Developers can track actions such as adding, updating, or deleting items on the map. You can also listen for user interactions like mouse clicks or shape updates.

### 5. Real-time Object Control  
Modify the properties of map objects during runtime, such as updating the location or changing icons.

## Usage Scenarios  
1. **Real-time Tracking:** Track moving objects by updating marker positions or icons in real time.  
2. **Custom Drawing Tools:** Allow users to draw zones, routes, or other shapes on the map.  
3. **Dynamic Provider Switching:** Switch between different map providers based on context (e.g., terrain vs satellite view).
